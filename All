Got it — instead of breaking into multiple Jira stories, we can make **one consolidated story** for "Claim Inquiry Assistant Enhancements" that covers all the possible improvements from your Excel list.

Here’s a draft you can paste into the Jira **Description**:

**Story Title:** Claim Inquiry Assistant Enhancements

**Description:**
Enhance the existing Claim Inquiry Assistant to improve predictive capabilities, provide proactive alerts, streamline appeal processes, and deliver advanced claim insights across multiple scenarios.

**Enhancement Scope:**

1. **Before Claim Status/Denial**

   * Claim denial prediction based on past claims and plan rules.
   * Auto alerts for high denial risk to notify members before denial happens.
   * Pre-submission checks for provider use cases.

2. **After a Denial**

   * Auto-fill appeal letters using denial reason, plan info, and member data.
   * Appeal status tracking to keep members informed.
   * Escalation smart routing based on denial type/urgency.

3. **Across Multiple Claims**

   * Summarize claim history for trend analysis.
   * Flag underpayments or billing errors for review.
   * Detect duplicate claims from providers.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Predictions and alerts are visible to the member before claim submission.
* Appeal letter auto-fill pulls accurate claim and plan data.
* Appeal status is updated in near real-time and accessible via the assistant.
* Escalations are routed to the correct handling team automatically.
* Claim history view provides an aggregated summary with trends and flags.

If you want, I can also do the same for **Eligibility & Benefits Checker Enhancements** so it’s in a single Jira story format like this one. That way both agents have clean, ready-to-use Jira descriptions. Would you like me to do that?
