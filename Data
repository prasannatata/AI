Here’s a **Jira story** for importing data from your personal org to **psdev** using the Salesforce Data Import Wizard, in the same concise, structured format you’ve been using.

**Story Title:**
Data Migration – Import Data from Personal Org to PSDEV Using Data Import Wizard

---

**Description**
Migrate required Salesforce records from the personal org to the PSDEV environment using the Data Import Wizard.
The import must maintain record integrity, respect object relationships, and comply with field mapping requirements for Payer Agent and related objects (Member\_\_c, Claim\_\_c, Appeal\_\_c, Plan\_\_c).

---

**Acceptance Criteria**

* **Given** the data export from the personal org is ready
  **When** importing into PSDEV
  **Then** the following must be ensured:

  * Correct mapping of source fields to PSDEV fields
  * All mandatory fields are populated
  * Related records (e.g., Member → Claim → Appeal) are linked correctly using external IDs or lookups
  * No duplicate records are created unless intended
  * Import completes without validation or mapping errors

* **Given** the import completes successfully
  **Then** a verification process confirms:

  * Record counts match expected totals
  * Key records open correctly in PSDEV
  * Relationships are intact (parent-child links)

---

**Design / Steps**

1. **Export from Personal Org:**

   * Use Salesforce Data Export or Data Loader to extract required objects (Member\_\_c, Claim\_\_c, Appeal\_\_c, Plan\_\_c, Denial Codes, etc.)
   * Include External ID fields for relationship mapping.

2. **Prepare Data for Import:**

   * Clean data in Excel/CSV to ensure mandatory fields are filled and formats match PSDEV field types.
   * Adjust picklist values if needed to match PSDEV configurations.

3. **Import into PSDEV Using Data Import Wizard:**

   * Navigate to **Setup → Data Import Wizard**
   * Select each object in sequence (starting with parent objects, e.g., Plan\_\_c, then Member\_\_c, then Claim\_\_c, then Appeal\_\_c)
   * Upload CSV, map fields, enable “Match using External IDs”
   * Run import and monitor progress

4. **Post-Import Validation:**

   * Verify record counts and sample data in PSDEV
   * Run reports to check data integrity and relationships
   * Fix any failed or partial imports and re-run

If you’d like, I can also make you a **relationship import order diagram** showing the exact sequence to load Member → Claim → Appeal to avoid lookup failures. That would make this story execution much easier.

Do you want me to create that diagram?
