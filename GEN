Here is the Acceptance Criteria in the **Given/When/Then** format, focused on the core functionalities of what a Service Agent (Agentforce) does:

***

### Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then Format)

**1. Automated Case Resolution**
- **Given** a customer submits a common inquiry (e.g., order status, password reset),
- **When** the Service Agent receives the request,
- **Then** the Agent automatically provides the correct response and logs the interaction in the case record.[1][2]

**2. Escalation of Complex Cases**
- **Given** a customer presents an inquiry that the Agent cannot resolve based on available knowledge and permissions,
- **When** the Agent determines escalation is required,
- **Then** the Agent routes the case to a human service agent, transferring all previous interaction details.[3][4]

**3. Real-Time Data Utilization**
- **Given** the customer account data and case history are available in Salesforce,
- **When** the Agent handles a case,
- **Then** the Agent uses this data to provide contextual, personalized responses.[5][6]

**4. Multi-Channel Support**
- **Given** the customer initiates contact via any supported channel (web, email, chat, social media),
- **When** a request is made,
- **Then** the Agent responds consistently and autonomously across all these channels.[4][6]

**5. Activity Logging and Auditing**
- **Given** the Agent performs an action or communicates with the customer,
- **When** the action is completed,
- **Then** a record of the Agentâ€™s activity is created and can be audited within the Service Console.[2][6]

***

These criteria ensure the **core functionalities** of automated response, escalation, data use, omnichannel consistency, and auditable records are addressed by the Service Agent platform.[1][3][4]
