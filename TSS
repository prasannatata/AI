Got it â€” if we put all that detail into Jira **as-is**, it will be a wall of text.
The trick is to **chunk it into collapsible, scan-friendly sections** using Jiraâ€™s supported Markdown / formatting so that:

* Itâ€™s readable without scrolling forever
* Each section can be checked off by QA or dev
* Flows and Prompt Template actions are clear

Hereâ€™s how Iâ€™d structure your Jira story with **headings, bullet points, code formatting for fields**, and collapsible panels for the heavy detail.

## **Jira Ticket Layout â€“ Readable & Complete**

### **Story Title**

**Payer Agent â€“ Full Build (Data Model, Topics, Enhancements, Security, Data Setup, E2E Testing)**

---

### **Description**

Implement the Payer Agent with existing topics and enhancements, configure the Salesforce data model, secure PHI, prepare demo datasets, and complete end-to-end testing.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria (High Level)**

* Agent retrieves accurate claim data in real-time.
* Predictive denial alerts appear before claim is denied.
* Appeals auto-generate with correct data.
* Claim history summaries highlight trends & anomalies.
* Duplicate claims detection works.
* Escalations route correctly.
* PHI is only shown to authenticated, authorized users.
* E2E testing passes without major defects.

**Sample Data Matrix**

| Member  | Scenario                   | Expected Behavior                                             |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MEM-001 | Approved claim             | Get Claim Status â†’ Paid, \$0 responsibility                   |
| MEM-002 | Denied â€“ Medical Necessity | Denial Reason explains code â†’ Appeal Assistance drafts letter |
| MEM-003 | High-risk pre-submission   | Prediction alert before denial                                |
| MEM-004 | Underpayment               | Summarize History flags issue                                 |
| MEM-005 | Duplicate claims           | Detect Duplicates flags both                                  |
| MEM-006 | Appeal in progress         | Appeal Status Tracking updates                                |
| MEM-007 | Email lookup               | Lists claims for selection                                    |

**Denial Codes Catalog**

* Load top 10 CARC + RARC codes with plain descriptions

**Plan Rules**

* Preauth requirements, out-of-network policies (used in prediction)

**Channels**

* Experience Cloud, Lightning utility, Mobile Quick Actions

</details>

---

#### **5. E2E Testing**

* **Interactive sandbox**: Test each topic individually
* **Batch scenarios**: Validate escalation triggers, predictions, and duplicate detection
* Confirm security enforcement for PHI
* Test web & mobile integration

---

### **Linked Work Items**

* PSE-124 Create Payer Agent
* PSE-193 Claim Inquiry Assistant Enhancements
* Related sub-tasks for each topic & configuration step

---

If we put it in **this format in Jira**:

* Headers = **bold** section names
* Tables = for sample data
* `<details>` tag for hiding bulk content (works in Jira Cloud Markdown)
* Code blocks for field lists

â€¦it will be **readable, scannable, and still complete** without overwhelming the page.

---

If you want, I can **now take this structure and fill in your exact field names, sample data values, and flow/prompt names** so you can paste it directly into your Jira story with zero edits.
Do you want me to prepare that final Jira-ready version?
