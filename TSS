Got it â€” if we put all that detail into Jira **as-is**, it will be a wall of text.
The trick is to **chunk it into collapsible, scan-friendly sections** using Jiraâ€™s supported Markdown / formatting so that:

* Itâ€™s readable without scrolling forever
* Each section can be checked off by QA or dev
* Flows and Prompt Template actions are clear

Hereâ€™s how Iâ€™d structure your Jira story with **headings, bullet points, code formatting for fields**, and collapsible panels for the heavy detail.

## **Jira Ticket Layout â€“ Readable & Complete**

### **Story Title**

**Payer Agent â€“ Full Build (Data Model, Topics, Enhancements, Security, Data Setup, E2E Testing)**

---

### **Description**

Implement the Payer Agent with existing topics and enhancements, configure the Salesforce data model, secure PHI, prepare demo datasets, and complete end-to-end testing.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria (High Level)**

* Agent retrieves accurate claim data in real-time.
* Predictive denial alerts appear before claim is denied.
* Appeals auto-generate with correct data.
* Claim history summaries highlight trends & anomalies.
* Duplicate claims detection works.
* Escalations route correctly.
* PHI is only shown to authenticated, authorized users.

**Denial Codes Catalog**

* Load top 10 CARC + RARC codes with plain descriptions

**Plan Rules**

* Preauth requirements, out-of-network policies (used in prediction)

**Channels**

* Experience Cloud, Lightning utility, Mobile Quick Actions

</details>

---

#### **5. E2E Testing**

* **Interactive sandbox**: Test each topic individually
* **Batch scenarios**: Validate escalation triggers, predictions, and duplicate detection
* Confirm security enforcement for PHI
* Test web & mobile integration

---

### **Linked Work Items**

* PSE-124 Create Payer Agent
* PSE-193 Claim Inquiry Assistant Enhancements
* Related sub-tasks for each topic & configuration step

---

If we put it in **this format in Jira**:

* Headers = **bold** section names
* Tables = for sample data
* `<details>` tag for hiding bulk content (works in Jira Cloud Markdown)
* Code blocks for field lists

â€¦it will be **readable, scannable, and still complete** without overwhelming the page.

---

If you want, I can **now take this structure and fill in your exact field names, sample data values, and flow/prompt names** so you can paste it directly into your Jira story with zero edits.
Do you want me to prepare that final Jira-ready version?

Got it â€” so instead of forcing every row into the **Flow â†’ Prompt Template** pattern, the **Related Actions** column should just say exactly whatâ€™s happening â€” whether itâ€™s only a Flow, only a Prompt Template, or both.

Hereâ€™s the updated **Topics & Related Actions** table:

If you want, I can **add a third column** here for **Type** (Existing or Enhancement) so itâ€™s instantly clear whatâ€™s already live vs. whatâ€™s new in this build. That would make it perfect for Jira and sprint planning.

Do you want me to add that type column?
