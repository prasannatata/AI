Here’s the **Jira story for “Detect Duplicate Claims from Providers”** in the same format as your screenshot:

---

**Story Title:**
Payer Agent – Detect Duplicate Claims from Providers – Related Action

---

**Description**
Implement a feature in the Payer Agent that identifies and flags duplicate claims submitted by the same provider for the same service date and/or procedure code.
The system should retrieve relevant claim data, compare it against existing claims, and indicate any duplicates found.
This enables members and support staff to quickly address potential billing errors and avoid overpayment.

---

**Acceptance Criteria**

* **Given** the user provides a valid Claim ID or Member ID
  **When** matching claims exist with the same provider, service date, and/or procedure code
  **Then** the agent should:

  * Flag the claim(s) as potential duplicates
  * Display a list of the duplicate claim IDs and key details (date, provider, billed amount)
  * Recommend next steps (e.g., review with billing team, request claim void)

* **Given** no matching duplicate claims are found
  **Then** the agent should confirm that no duplicates exist for the given claim or member.

* Duplicate check results must only be visible to authenticated, authorized users in compliance with PHI security policies.

    4. Mark matches as Duplicate\_Flag\_\_c = true
    5. Return results with details of all duplicates found

If you want, I can now package **all these enhancement stories** (Auto Alerts, Appeal Status Tracking, Summarize Claim History, Detect Duplicates) into **one combined Jira Epic description** so your backlog stays organized.

Do you want me to create that Epic summary next?
