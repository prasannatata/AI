Perfect — here’s a refined, **clear and structured version** of your script that’s **on-point but slightly more descriptive**, so it reads well even without someone speaking it. This version is ready to show in slides or present live with minimal explanation:

## Payer GenAI Agents – What We’ve Built and What’s Next

---

### Agent 1: Claims Inquiry Assistant

**What It Does Today**

* Members can check the real-time status of their medical claims
* Displays billed amount, paid amount, denial reason (if any), and provider info
* Explains CARC/RARC denial codes in plain English
* Offers reimbursement estimate based on member responsibility
* Includes optional email verification before sharing PHI
* If unresolved, can trigger support escalation (task or live agent handoff)

**Where We Can Extend It**

* Predict claim denials before submission based on rules and patterns
* Auto-fill appeals using member data, plan language, and denial codes
* Highlight provider billing errors or duplicate claims across members
* Add alerts for underpaid or out-of-network claims needing review
* Summarize complex claim histories for agents to speed up handling

---

### Agent 2: Eligibility & Benefits Checker

**What It Does Today**

* Members can ask if a service is covered (e.g., MRI, physical therapy)
* Returns copay, coinsurance, deductible details for the specific benefit
* Identifies whether prior authorization is required
* Checks visit limits, benefit caps, and exclusions
* Email verification can be used to personalize the response

**Where We Can Extend It**

* Let users check if a provider is in-network for their plan
* Add prior auth request support (draft forms or route to portal)
* Track used vs. remaining benefits (e.g., “3 visits left this year”)
* Compare benefits across multiple plans during open enrollment
* Answer drug coverage or formulary questions using plan-specific rules

---

### How These Two Agents Can Work Together

* After checking eligibility, link directly to relevant claims for that service
* If a claim is denied, backtrack to benefits or auth gaps
* Show trends: high denial rates for uncovered services can drive plan education
* Add handoff logic: “This wasn’t covered — would you like to appeal?”
