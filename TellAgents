## Payer GenAI Agents ‚Äì What We‚Äôve Built and What‚Äôs Next

---

### Agent 1: Claims Inquiry Assistant

**What It Does Today**

* Members can check the real-time status of their medical claims
* Displays billed amount, paid amount, denial reason (if any), and provider info
* Explains CARC/RARC denial codes in plain English
* Offers reimbursement estimate based on member responsibility
* Includes optional email verification before sharing PHI
* If unresolved, can trigger support escalation (task or live agent handoff)

**Where We Can Extend It**

* Predict claim denials before submission based on rules and patterns
* Auto-fill appeals using member data, plan language, and denial codes
* Highlight provider billing errors or duplicate claims across members
* Add alerts for underpaid or out-of-network claims needing review
* Summarize complex claim histories for agents to speed up handling

---

### Agent 2: Eligibility & Benefits Checker

**What It Does Today**

* Members can ask if a service is covered (e.g., MRI, physical therapy)
* Returns copay, coinsurance, deductible details for the specific benefit
* Identifies whether prior authorization is required
* Checks visit limits, benefit caps, and exclusions
* Email verification can be used to personalize the response

**Where We Can Extend It**

* Let users check if a provider is in-network for their plan
* Add prior auth request support (draft forms or route to portal)
* Track used vs. remaining benefits (e.g., ‚Äú3 visits left this year‚Äù)
* Compare benefits across multiple plans during open enrollment
* Answer drug coverage or formulary questions using plan-specific rules

---

### How These Two Agents Can Work Together

* After checking eligibility, link directly to relevant claims for that service
* If a claim is denied, backtrack to benefits or auth gaps
* Show trends: high denial rates for uncovered services can drive plan education
* Add handoff logic: ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt covered ‚Äî would you like to appeal?‚Äù

Let me know if you'd like to convert this into a polished slide deck or show specific flows next to each feature.







Here‚Äôs a full list of **high-impact, AI-powered payer use cases** in your preferred **clean, structured format** ‚Äî quick to scan, easy to explain in conversation or show on slides.

### ‚úÖ 1. Diagnostic Test Optimization

**Problem**: Members undergo unnecessary or duplicate tests
**Agent Can**:
‚Ä¢ Check if test is needed (based on history, diagnosis)
‚Ä¢ Flag duplicates or suggest alternatives
‚Ä¢ Show member cost before approval
**Impact**: Reduces waste, supports value-based care, prevents billing shocks




Great question ‚Äî let‚Äôs break this down. You already listed what your **Claims Inquiry Assistant** does today. To identify **where extensions are possible**, you can look at it from 3 **natural pivot points** in the current flow:

---

### üîπ 1. **Post-Claim Submission ‚Äî Before Denial Happens**

**Where in the current flow**:
‚û° *Before the member sees the status or denial reason*

**Extensions you can add here**:

* **Claim Denial Prediction**: Based on past claims and plan rules
* **Auto Alerts for High Denial Risk**: Notify before denial happens
* **Pre-submission Checks** (for provider use case)

üìå *Why this matters*: You're shifting from reactive to proactive. Members and providers get ahead of denials, improving outcomes.

---

### üîπ 2. **After a Denial ‚Äî Right When Reason is Shown**

**Where in the current flow**:
‚û° *After denial reason (CARC/RARC) is explained*

**Extensions you can add here**:

* **Auto-Fill Appeal Letter**: Use denial reason + plan info + member data
* **Appeal Status Tracking**: Let the member track what‚Äôs happening
* **Escalation Smart Routing**: Route based on denial type/urgency

üìå *Why this matters*: You‚Äôre helping members take the *next step*, not just explaining the issue.

---

### üîπ 3. **Across Multiple Claims ‚Äî Pattern Recognition**

**Where in the current flow**:
‚û° *When members ask about multiple claims, or support teams are involved*

**Extensions you can add here**:

* **Summarize Claim History**: One view for support agents
* **Flag Underpayments or Billing Errors**: Based on peer/member trends
* **Detect Duplicate Claims from Providers**

üìå *Why this matters*: This helps with **internal audit**, faster issue resolution, and proactive recovery.
