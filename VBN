Here’s the **Jira story for “Summarize Claim History”** in the same format as your screenshot:

---

**Story Title:**
Payer Agent – Summarize Claim History – Related Action

---

**Description**
Implement a feature in the Payer Agent that retrieves and summarizes a member’s complete claim history.
The system should aggregate claims, identify trends, highlight recurring issues, and flag potential problems such as underpayments or repeated denials.
This allows members and support agents to quickly understand the overall claim pattern without manually reviewing individual claims.

---

**Acceptance Criteria**

* **Given** the user provides a valid Member ID or Email
  **When** claims exist for that member
  **Then** the agent should retrieve and summarize claim history including:

  * Count of claims by status (Paid, Denied, In Review, etc.)
  * Common denial codes and reasons
  * High-value claims or frequent providers
  * Flags for underpayment or other anomalies

* **Given** no claims exist for the member
  **Then** the agent should inform the user that there is no claim history available.

* Summary must be presented in plain language, be easy to understand, and only be shown to authenticated, authorized users in compliance with PHI security policies.

If you’d like, I can now write **Detect Duplicate Claims** in the exact same Jira format so your set of enhancement stories is complete.
Do you want me to prepare that next?
