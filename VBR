Here’s the **Jira story for “Appeal Status Tracking”** in the same format as your screenshot:

---

**Story Title:**
Payer Agent – Appeal Status Tracking – Related Action

---

**Description**
Implement a feature in the Payer Agent that retrieves and displays the current status of an appeal for a denied claim.
The system should fetch the appeal record linked to the claim, show the latest status and key dates, and present the information in a member-friendly format.
This helps members stay informed about the progress of their appeal without having to contact support.

---

**Acceptance Criteria**

* **Given** the user provides a valid Claim ID or Appeal ID
  **When** an appeal record exists for that claim
  **Then** the agent should retrieve the appeal details, including:

  * Current appeal status (e.g., Draft, Submitted, In Review, Approved, Denied)
  * Submission date and decision date (if available)
  * Any pending actions or requests for additional information

* **Given** no appeal record exists for the provided claim
  **Then** the agent should inform the user that no appeal is currently on file.

* The appeal status should be displayed in plain language and must only be accessible to authenticated, authorized users in compliance with PHI security policies.

    4. Return retrieved details to the prompt (if applicable)
    5. If no appeal found, return “No appeal on file” response

  * **Prompt Template (optional):**

    * Display the status in plain language (e.g., “Your appeal is currently in review. We expect a decision by \[date].”)

If you want, I can also prepare **Claim Denial Prediction**, **Summarize Claim History**, and **Detect Duplicate Claims** in this same Jira format so your Payer Agent enhancement tickets are complete and consistent.

Do you want me to go ahead and do that?
