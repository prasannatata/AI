| **Claims Status Inquiries & Customer Service** | High volume of claim status queries (\~15% of administrative workload) is handled through call centers, overwhelming staff. Legacy systems (Facets, QNXT, HealthEdge, Epic Tapestry) require navigating multiple screens and codes to find status, leading to long handle times. Members endure long waits and confusing EOB codes, causing frustration and repeat calls.                                                                                                                                 | Deploy an AI-driven claims agent integrated with core systems to provide real-time status updates. It delivers plain-language explanations of claim status and next steps (no jargon) to members or agents instantly. The agent is available 24/7 via chat/voice, enabling self-service claim status inquiries without waiting for a human representative.                                                                                                                                               | Shortens inquiry handling from \~14 minutes to seconds, alleviating call center workload. Eliminates the \~\$12 cost of each manual inquiry, reducing operational expenses. Improves first-call resolution and member satisfaction by providing fast, clear answers, thereby reducing call volume and follow-up inquiries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Claims Denial & Appeals Management**         | High initial denial rates (\~20% of claims) strain operations. Cryptic denial codes (CARC/RARC) in Facets/QNXT outputs require expert interpretation and often leave providers confused. Appeals are processed manually with lengthy ~~30-day resolutions, risking non-compliance. Reworking denials is costly (~~\$25 per claim) and as many as 60% of denied claims are never resubmitted, causing lost revenue and member/provider dissatisfaction.                                                    | Leverage the AI claims agent to automatically interpret denial codes into clear, member/provider-friendly language with actionable guidance. It proactively flags denials, initiates appeal workflows instantly when appropriate, and auto-gathers necessary documentation. The agent provides staff with prioritized queues and recommended fixes (e.g. missing info, coding errors) and ensures no appeal deadlines are missed by tracking and alerting in real time.                                  | Speeds up denial resolution – reducing appeal turnaround from weeks to days by immediate triage and action. Cuts down manual rework effort and expense (saving roughly \$25 per appealed claim) and recoups revenue by addressing the 60% of unworked denials. Delivers consistent, transparent explanations to providers and members, reducing confusion and preventing avoidable appeals or complaints.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Member Experience & Quality (CAHPS/Star)**   | Unresolved claim issues and poor communication drive member dissatisfaction (health plans’ NPS \~19%, one of the lowest among industries). Claim frustrations translate into formal grievances, low CAHPS survey scores, and higher member attrition. Given that member experience now comprises \~57% of Medicare Star Ratings, these pain points directly threaten quality scores. Frequent complaints and slow appeals can drag down a plan’s Star Rating, putting substantial bonus payments at risk. | Utilize the claims AI agent to provide proactive, empathetic communication throughout the claim journey. It keeps members informed of claim status changes or issues in plain English and offers immediate assistance or escalation for their concerns. By resolving questions on the first contact and guiding members through next steps (like how to address a denial or file an appeal) seamlessly, the agent turns a traditionally frustrating process into a supportive, user-friendly experience. | Elevates member satisfaction and trust by dramatically improving service interactions (fewer transfers, faster answers). Higher CAHPS scores and better customer service ratings boost Star performance, safeguarding incentive payments. In fact, maintaining a 4★+ rating (a threshold easier to reach with improved CX) is critical – dropping below it can cost a plan hundreds of millions in lost bonuses. Fewer complaints and quicker issue resolution not only enhance loyalty and retention but also contribute to a stronger competitive position in the market. |




About 20% of claims are denied, many never resubmitted. Denial codes in systems like Facets/QNXT are cryptic, appeals take ~30 days, and each rework costs ~$25 — driving lost revenue, compliance risk, and frustrated providers/members.


AI agent translates denial codes into clear guidance, auto-initiates appeals with required docs, and tracks deadlines to prevent delays.



Speeds up appeals from weeks to days, saving ~$25 per claim. Recovers revenue from the 60% of denials that go unworked, while giving clear, consistent explanations that reduce confusion and complaints.




Unclear and delayed claims frustrate members, create complaints, and lower satisfaction. Poor experiences hurt Star Ratings and put bonus revenue at risk.

Inadequate claim transparency results in negative feedback harming one's reputation, lower CAHPS/STAR scores with lost CMS bonuses, and  losing members.
