Here’s your **Jira story for "Auto Alerts for High Denial Risk"** in the same format shown in your screenshot:

**Story Title:**
Payer Agent – Auto Alerts for High Denial Risk – Related Action

---

**Description**
Implement a feature in the Payer Agent that proactively alerts members when a claim has a high probability of denial before it is finalized.
The system should analyze claim history and plan rules, calculate a denial risk score, and trigger an alert if the risk is above the configured threshold.
This helps members take preventive action such as verifying coverage, submitting required documentation, or correcting coding errors before the claim decision.

---

**Acceptance Criteria**

* **Given** the user provides a valid Claim ID or Member ID
  **When** the claim is in “In Review” or “Pending” status
  **Then** the agent should evaluate historical claim patterns and plan rules to calculate a denial risk score.

* **Given** the calculated risk score is above the configured threshold (e.g., ≥70%)
  **Then** the agent should display a proactive high-risk denial alert to the member with:

  * Risk percentage
  * Likely reasons for potential denial
  * Recommended next steps

* **Given** the claim risk is below the threshold
  **Then** the agent should confirm no action is needed at this time.

* The alert should only be visible to authenticated, authorized users and must comply with PHI security policies.
