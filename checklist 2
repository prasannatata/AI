#### ✅ Step 4: Configure Topics & Actions

**Topics** define what the agent can talk about.
**Actions** define what the agent can *do*.

1. Navigate to the Service Agent’s record → **Topics & Actions**.

2. Add or customize topics:

   * **General FAQ:** Use Knowledge Articles to answer common support questions.
   * **Case Creation:** Automatically open new support cases.
   * **Escalation:** Escalate to a live agent when the issue cannot be resolved.
   * **Order/Billing Inquiries:** (optional, if relevant to your org).

3. Configure actions within topics:

   * **Knowledge Retrieval:** Link to Salesforce Knowledge articles.
   * **Case Update Action:** Update or append information to an existing Case.
   * **Escalation Action:** Create escalation tasks or Omni‑Channel handoff.
   * **Custom Actions:** Create Flows or Prompt Templates for org‑specific tasks (e.g., “Check Warranty,” “Reset Password”).

---

#### ✅ Step 5: Prepare Testing

**Create CSV for Testing Center**

* Columns:

  * *Customer Query | Expected Response | Escalation Required (Yes/No)*
* Example:

  ```
  "How do I reset my password?","Provide password reset steps","No"
  "I was double charged for my order","Escalate to live agent","Yes"
  ```

**Run Tests**

1. Navigate to **Setup → Agentforce Testing Center**.
2. Upload the CSV test file.
3. Validate:

   * Responses match expected results.
   * Escalations trigger correctly.

**Review Results**

* Use Testing Center results page to identify gaps.
* Optimize topics or actions based on accuracy.
