* Case Automation: Create and update HR/IT cases automatically.
* Escalation: Route sensitive or unresolved requests to live support agents.
* Omni-Channel: Available in Lightning Experience, Salesforce Mobile App, and optionally Slack.

**Key Benefits**

* Faster resolution for employees.
* Reduced HR/IT backlog.
* Improved employee experience with self-service.
* Better visibility into trends through Agentforce Analytics.

### Setup Instructions

#### Step 1: Create the Employee Agent

1. Navigate to Setup → Agentforce Employee Agents → New Agent.
2. Select Create from a Template.
3. Review the default topics and actions; remove any not relevant.
4. Define agent settings:

   * System messages (greetings, fallbacks, escalation messages).
   * Language settings.
5. Select a data source for Knowledge grounding:

   * Use Salesforce Knowledge OR
   * Create a Data Library (limit agent responses to specific articles/files).
6. Click Create.

---

#### Step 2: Configure Topics & Actions

**Topics** define what the agent can do; **Actions** are the tools used.

* HR FAQs: Answer questions from Knowledge (benefits, PTO, payroll).
* IT Support: Troubleshooting, password resets, VPN help.
* Case Creation: Open HR or IT cases.
* Escalation: Route unresolved or sensitive issues to human agents.

**Actions** include:

* Answer Questions with Knowledge
* Create/Update Case
* Escalation via Omni-Channel Flow
* Custom Actions (for organization-specific processes such as equipment requests or system access).

**Filters & Variables**

* Create filters so certain topics/actions are only available under conditions (for example, authenticated user).
* Use variables (for example, EmployeeID, Department) for personalization and security.

---

#### Step 3: Assign User Access

**Option 1: Permission Sets**

1. Go to Setup → Permission Sets → New.
2. Add label and API name → Save.
3. Under Agent Access → Edit, enable the Employee Agent.
4. Assign the permission set to users via Manage Assignments → Add Assignments.

**Option 2: Profiles**

1. Go to Setup → Profiles.
2. Select a profile → Enabled Agent Access → Edit.
3. Enable the Employee Agent → Save.

When active, the Employee Agent appears in the Agentforce panel (Lightning Experience and Salesforce Mobile). If a user has multiple agents, they can select which one to use from a dropdown.

---

#### Step 4: Test the Agent

**Using Agentforce Builder**

* Simulate real conversations.
* Validate flows, actions, and escalation behavior.

**Using Agentforce Testing Center**

* Create a CSV (columns: Employee Query | Expected Response | Escalation Required).
* Upload to Testing Center → Run tests.
* Review batch results for accuracy and escalation triggers.
* Enable Enhanced Event Logs to capture full conversation history for 7 days.

---

#### Step 5: Deploy to Channels

* Lightning Experience (default).
* Salesforce Mobile App.
* Slack (optional) → Connect via Agentforce Slack integration.
* Configure Omni-Channel Flows:

  * Inbound Flow routes employee queries to the Employee Agent.
  * Outbound Flow escalates to HR/IT queues or live agents.

**Agent Surfaces**

* Customize responses per channel (for example, structured format in Mobile, conversational tone in Slack).

---

#### Step 6: Activate the Agent

* Activate when ready → makes the agent available in all assigned channels.
* To update Topics/Actions later, deactivate, edit, then reactivate.

---

#### Step 7: Monitor & Improve

* Use Agentforce Analytics (via Data Cloud) for insights:

  * Accuracy, usage, escalations, ROI.
* Build Data Cloud reports to track adherence to instructions.
* Continuously improve Knowledge and filters based on feedback.

---

#### Step 8: Extend the Agent

* Call the Employee Agent from Flows or Apex (for example, onboarding automation).
* Use invocable actions for event-driven or background tasks.
* Expand to additional internal tools/channels as needed.

---

### Deliverables

* Employee Agent created from a template.
* Topics & Actions configured (HR, IT, Case Creation, Escalation).
* Access granted via Permission Sets/Profiles.
* Tested in Builder + Testing Center (CSV validated).
* Deployed to Lightning Experience, Mobile, and Slack (if required).
* Activated and monitored with Agentforce Analytics.
